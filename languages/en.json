    "routine-subtitel":"Simplifying the overly complex creation of series elements for people with little technical flair",
    "routine-einleitung": "Inventsys is a software company for digital maintenance in Switzerland and Germany. Routines are settings / 'data containers' that generate previously defined tasks as repetitive jobs. For our customer group, the creation and assignment is too complex and they lack an overview. This project therefore gave rise to two sub-projects, 'Routines' and 'Planning', which I was responsible for planning and designing. I had the opportunity to manage another project in 08.23, which is why I had to pass on the completion of the planning.",
    "routine-das-problem": "The user receives no feedback from the system regarding the creation of the routines.",
    "routine-das-problem3": "The coordinator has no overview of the tasks created/completed from routines.",

    "routine-userResearchBulletpoints5": "We tried an independent Figma test run with some power users",
    "routine-userResearchinsights": "Many of our interviewees are tech-savvy, but their employees are not.",
    "routine-userResearchinsights2": "The difficulties were due to unclear terminology and different steps in different places",
    "routine-userResearchinsights3": "Visual feedback was desired, namely a calendar function 'like Outlook'",
    "routine-userResearchinsights4": "While I saw the routines internally as a data container, for customers it is a serial element like Outlook - the technical differentiation is only necessary in the script.",
    "routine-userResearchpersona": " I created personas based on the interviews and various conversations with the sales team",
    "routine-userResearchpersona2": "I then defined 2 main personas with the team.The manager, who is usually in the office and has hardly any touchpoints with the mobile version, and the individual who creates the tasks themselves and carries them out in the field in the app.",
